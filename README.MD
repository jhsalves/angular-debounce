# @ng2-debounce-direcive

Angular 2 directive to add debounce behaviour on elements based in a list of events 

## Installation

To install this library, run:

```bash
$ npm install ng2-debounce-directive --save
```

## Consuming your library

Once you have published your library to npm, you can import your library in any Angular application by running:

```bash
$ npm install ng2-debounce-directive
```

and then from your Angular `AppModule`:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

// Import your library
import { Debounce } from 'ng2-debounce-directive';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,

    // Specify your library as an import
    Debounce.forRoot()
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Once your library is imported, you can use its components, directives and pipes in your Angular application:

```xml
<!-- You can now use your library component in app.component.html -->
<input appDebounce [delay]="700" [events]="['keyup','mouseover',...]" (func)="some_binding_method()" [(ngModel)]="attribute">
```
